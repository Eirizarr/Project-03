      <p>
        Now i have many more interests  than listed above, but I feel like these
        are my top 3. Normally I dont go outdoor activities(air conditioning :))
        but if it's for paintball I'm out of the house. I love the rush of it,
        and I have my own gear so it is less expensive for me.

        I love coding becuase i see it more as amental game. It has challenges,
        and specific goals. Also you can "mod" your code in interesting ways.
        Sometimee all i need is a glass of arizona iced tea my laptop, and a
        problem, and I would be satisfied.

        Last of all, I enjoy playing videogames. I especiialy love roleplay
        games and straegy games. I enjoy xcom, crusader kings, and even
        stellaris. I play on ps4 more than anything else.
